# Dynamic_CPU_Management_for_Energy_Efficiency
This Bash script implements a dynamic CPU management system for optimizing energy efficiency in Linux systems. It predicts CPU usage based on idle time, calculates energy consumption, and toggles CPU cores accordingly. By intelligently turning CPU cores on or off based on predicted usage, the script aims to balance performance and energy.
